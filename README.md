# Water-Level-Indicator

• Prototyped a water level detection system as an embedded system on an HC12 Microcontroller
• A DC motor simulated the water pumping into a tank, and push-buttons were pressed to simulate different water levels. LED
lights indicated the water level graphically, while an LCD display indicated it numerically. An audio buzzer was automatically
triggered when the tank was simulated as full
• All devices were connected to the HC12 via memory-mapped I/O, and the HC12 was programmed in Assembly
